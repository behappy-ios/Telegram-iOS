## What this is

BeHappy for iOS is the official iOS client for the BeHappy messenger.
It is built on top of the Telegram-iOS codebase, with the following
high-level modifications:

- Networking layer rewritten to use the **MVSy 1.0** protocol and
  connect to BeHappy backend servers (instead of MTProto 2.0 / Telegram
  DCs).
- Branding, visual identity, and product naming replaced throughout.
- Telegram-specific features removed where not applicable to BeHappy
  (e.g., Telegram Premium subscriptions, Telegram Stars, Fragment
  integration, sponsored messages).
- Additional features added that are unique to BeHappy.

The complete list of changes is tracked in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Compliance with upstream README requirements

The upstream Telegram-iOS README requests the following from forks. We
comply as follows:

| Upstream request | Status in this fork |
|---|---|
| Obtain your own api_id | N/A — BeHappy uses MVSy 1.0, not MTProto |
| Don't use the name "Telegram" | ✅ Rebranded to BeHappy |
| Don't use Telegram's logo | ✅ Independent BeHappy logo |
| Follow security guidelines | ✅ Inherited from upstream |
| Publish your code | ✅ This repository is public |

## Relationship to upstream

| | Telegram for iOS | BeHappy for iOS |
|---|---|---|
| Upstream LICENSE file | Not present | (See NOTICE — fork author license: GPL v2+) |
| Backend | Telegram DCs | BeHappy servers (`mvsy.behappy.rest`) |
| Protocol | MTProto 2.0 | MVSy 1.0 |
| Trademarks | Telegram | BeHappy |
| Account compatibility | Telegram accounts | BeHappy accounts (separate system) |
| Source repository | [TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS) | [behappy-ios/Telegram-iOS](https://github.com/behappy-ios/Telegram-iOS) |

We do **not** merge updates from upstream automatically. The fork is
independently maintained.

## Building from source

The build process is unchanged from upstream. Refer to the upstream
README's compilation instructions; substitute the BeHappy backend
endpoint for the Telegram DC list in the configuration step.

```sh
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/behappy-ios/Telegram-iOS.git
```

Then follow the upstream Xcode setup, configuration, and project
generation steps.
